Nodejs BMI Calculator Coding Challenge 

Problem Statement

Given the following JSON data
[{"Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 171, "WeightKg": 96 }, { "Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 161, "WeightKg":
85 }, { "Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 180, "WeightKg": 77 }, { "Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 166,
"WeightKg": 62}, {"Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 150, "WeightKg": 70}, {"Gender": "Female", 
"HeightCm": 167, "WeightKg": 82} as the input with weight and height parameters of a person, 
we have to perform the following:

1) Calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) using Formula 1, BMI Category and Health 
risk from Table 1 of the person and add them as 3 new columns.

2) Count the total number of overweight people using ranges in the column BMI 
Category of Table 1, check this is consistent programmatically and add any other 
observations in the documentation.

3) Create build, tests to make sure the code is working as expected and this can be 
added to an automation build / test / deployment pipeline.

Formula 1 - BMI
2 2 BMI(kg/m ) = mass(kg) / height(m)
The BMI (Body Mass Index) in (kg/m2 ) is equal to the weight in kilograms (kg) divided 
by your height in meters squared (m)2 . For example, if you are 175cm
3
(1.75m) in height and 75kg in weight, you can calculate your BMI as follows: 75kg / 
(1.75m2) = 24.49kg/m2

Table 1 - BMI Category and the Health Risk.
BMI Category
